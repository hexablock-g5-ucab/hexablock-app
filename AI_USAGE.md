# AI Usage — client (hexablock-app)

Mandatory per section 7 of the project statement. Every significant use of AI gets one entry here
(summary row) and one detailed file in `docs/ai-log/AI-xxx.md`. Entries are closed when their PR is
merged: no field may stay "Pending" after merge.

The `harness/` workflow is adapted from the reference repositories of Group 8 (github.com/arjperez-dev/frontend-poc-arrow and backend-poc-arrow), cited per the course integrity policy.
